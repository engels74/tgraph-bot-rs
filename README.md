High-performance Discord bot for automated Tautulli graph generation and posting, built with Rust and the Poise framework.

## Overview

TGraph Bot Rust Edition is a complete rewrite of the original Python TGraph Bot, designed for maximum performance, reliability, and maintainability. It automatically generates and posts beautiful graphs from your Tautulli (Plex) data to Discord channels.

## Features

- **High Performance**: Built with Rust for zero-cost abstractions and memory safety
- **Discord Integration**: Modern slash commands using the Poise framework
- **Automated Scheduling**: Configurable graph generation and posting
- **Multiple Graph Types**: Daily play counts, user statistics, platform analytics, and more
- **Internationalization**: Multi-language support using Fluent localization
- **Hot Configuration Reloading**: Update settings without restarting the bot
- **Privacy Controls**: Configurable username censoring and data filtering
- **Type Safety**: Compile-time guarantees for configuration and data handling

## Architecture

This project uses a modular workspace structure:

- **`tgraph-bot`**: Main binary crate and application entry point
- **`tgraph-commands`**: Discord command implementations using Poise
- **`tgraph-config`**: Type-safe configuration management with hot-reloading
- **`tgraph-graphs`**: High-performance graph generation and rendering
- **`tgraph-i18n`**: Internationalization support using Fluent
- **`tgraph-common`**: Shared types, utilities, and common functionality

## Development Status

ðŸš§ **This project is currently under active development.**

See [docs/development_plan.md](docs/development_plan.md) for the complete implementation roadmap.

## Requirements
